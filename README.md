## 🔍 Code Quality & Analysis

### Linting Configuration

Each project must have:

<details>
<summary>Example Linting Commands</summary>

```bash
# Example for different tech stacks:
# Node.js/TypeScript: ESLint + Prettier
npm run lint

# Python: Pylint/Flake8/Black
pylint src/

# Java: Checkstyle/SpotBugs
mvn checkstyle:check

# Go: golangci-lint
golangci-lint run
```

</details>

### Requirements:

- ✅ Linter configuration files committed to repository
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks to run linting automatically
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline fails on linting errors
- ✅ IDE integration for real-time feedback

### Code Analysis Tools

Projects should integrate static analysis tools appropriate to their stack:

- **Security scanning** (e.g., Snyk, SonarQube, CodeQL)
- **Dependency vulnerability checks**
- **Code complexity metrics**
- **Type checking** (for applicable languages)

---

## 🔐 Version Control & Collaboration

### Branch Protection Rules

The `main` branch **MUST** be protected with the following rules:

✅ **Required:**

- Pull requests required before merging
- At least 1 approval from code reviewer required
- Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- Require status checks to pass before merging (linting, tests, builds)
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- No direct commits allowed to main branch

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from an existing issue
2. **Make your changes** following coding standards
3. **Write/update tests** for your changes
4. **Run tests locally** - all tests must pass
5. **Run linter** - no linting errors allowed
6. **Submit PR** with descriptive title and description
7. **Link PR to issue** - mandatory requirement
8. **Request review** from team members
9. **Address feedback** from code review
10. **Merge** only after approval and passing CI/CD checks

### AI Coding Assistant & GitHub Copilot

Code4ULBS projects leverage AI to accelerate development while maintaining high standards.

✅ **GitHub Copilot Pro:** All ULBS students have **FREE access** to GitHub Copilot Pro through the GitHub Student Developer Pack. It is highly recommended to use it.
✅ **AI Instructions:** Every project **MUST** maintain a `copilot-instructions.md` (or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) file. This file provides critical context to AI agents about project-specific conventions, architecture, and libraries.
✅ **Continuous Maintenance:** Update the instructions file whenever significant architectural changes or new patterns are introduced.

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing

**Requirements:**

- ✅ Minimum **80% code coverage**
- ✅ Tests run **before every commit** (pre-commit hook)
- ✅ Fast execution (unit tests should complete in < 5 minutes)
- ✅ Isolated tests (no external dependencies)
- ✅ Clear test naming conventions

**Example:**

<details>
<summary>Example Unit Test Commands</summary>

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test           # Node.js
pytest             # Python
mvn test           # Java
go test ./...      # Go
```

</details>

**Coverage reporting:**

<details>
<summary>Example Coverage Commands</summary>

```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
# Coverage reports should be available in CI/CD pipeline
```

</details>

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Requirements:**

- ✅ Automated E2E tests using tools like **Playwright**, Cypress, or Selenium
- ✅ Tests run **at least once daily** via GitHub Actions scheduled workflow
- ✅ Tests cover critical user journeys
- ✅ Tests run against staging environment before production deployment

**Example Playwright setup:**

<details>
<summary>Example Playwright Setup</summary>

```bash
# Install Playwright
npm install -D @playwright/test

# Run E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Run with UI
npx playwright test --ui
```

</details>

**GitHub Actions E2E workflow:**

<details>
<summary>Example E2E Workflow</summary>

```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 * * *" # Run daily at 2 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npx playwright test
```

</details>

### Testing Best Practices

- Write tests **before** or **alongside** code (TDD approach)
- Keep tests maintainable and readable
- Use test fixtures and factories for test data
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Keep E2E tests stable and reliable (minimize flakiness)

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Environments

### Environment Separation

Every project **MUST** have at least two environments:

#### 🟢 **Development/Staging**

- For testing features before production
- Connected to test/staging databases
- May have debug logging enabled
- Used for QA verification

#### 🔴 **Production**

- Live environment serving real users
- Optimized performance
- Minimal logging
- High availability and monitoring

**Environment Configuration:**

<details>
<summary>Example .env files</summary>

```bash
# Use environment variables for configuration
# .env.development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/dev_db
API_URL=https://api-staging.ulbs.ro

# .env.production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://prod-db:5432/prod_db
API_URL=https://api.ulbs.ro
```

</details>

### Containerization

The template supports **both Docker and Podman**. The base `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` (if present) are pre-configured for a standard Node.js environment.

#### Dockerfile Requirements:

<details>
<summary>Example Dockerfile</summary>

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimization
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

</details>

#### Docker Compose / Podman Compose:

<details>
<summary>Example Docker Compose</summary>

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml or compose.yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
```

</details>

**Commands:**

<details>
<summary>Example Container Commands</summary>

```bash
# Docker
docker build -t myapp .
docker-compose up

# Podman (should work identically)
podman build -t myapp .
podman-compose up
```

</details>

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

Make sure to automate deployments using Github Actions (GHA).

#### CI/CD Runner Requirements:

- ⚠️ **AVOID default GitHub runners** (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`).
- ✅ **USE ULBS organization runners** for all workflows.
- Use the runner label: `build-01` (or others as specified by the organization).

#### CI/CD Workflow structure:

<details>
<summary>View CI/CD Workflow (included in template)</summary>

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, build-01]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

  deploy-staging:
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    runs-on: [self-hosted, build-01]
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: echo "Deploy to staging"

  deploy-production:
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: [self-hosted, build-01]
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: echo "Deploy to production"
```

</details>

---

## � Database Management

Proper data management, backup strategies, and auditing are essential for all ULBS projects.

### 🛡️ Backups & Reliability
- ✅ **Automated Backups:** All databases must have a scheduled backup system (e.g., daily exports to secure storage).
- ✅ **Point-in-Time Recovery:** For critical applications, enable log-based recovery if supported by the provider.

### 🕵️ Audit Trails
All projects **SHOULD** implement automated auditing to track who changed what and when. This should ideally be handled at the framework or database level, not manually in business logic.

**Recommended Frameworks for Auditing:**

| Technology Stack | Recommended Auditing Tool |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Java / Spring Boot** | [Hibernate Envers](https://hibernate.org/orm/envers/) |
| **Node.js (TypeORM)** | [typeorm-extension](https://github.com/braid-group/typeorm-extension) or Custom Subscribers |
| **Python (Django)** | [django-simple-history](https://django-simple-history.readthedocs.io/) |
| **Python (SQLAlchemy)** | [SQLAlchemy-Continuum](https://sqlalchemy-continuum.readthedocs.io/) |
| **Go** | Custom middleware or DB-level triggers (e.g., GORM hooks) |

---

## 🔒 Security & Authentication

### 🔑 Authentication Requirements

ULBS follows a centralized authentication strategy to ensure security and simplify user management.

- ✅ **Google Authentication Only:** All applications **MUST** use Google Auth (ULBS Workspace accounts) for user authentication.
- ❌ **No Local Passwords:** Applications are **forbidden** from storing or managing user passwords at the application level.
- ✅ **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect:** Implement authentication using standard protocols (OIDC is preferred).

### 🤖 Dependabot

Dependabot **MUST** be activated for all repositories to ensure dependencies are kept up-to-date and secure.

- Enable **Dependabot security updates** and **Dependabot version updates** from the repository settings, section `Advanced Security`.

### 🤫 Secret Management

**NEVER** version secrets (API keys, passwords, database credentials) in the codebase.

- Use `.env.example` to document required environment variables.
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
- Use **GitHub Repository Secrets** for CI/CD pipelines (e.g., deployment keys, production API tokens).

#### How to use Repository Secrets:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret**.
4. In your GitHub Actions workflow, access the secret using `${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET_NAME }}`.

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

All ULBS projects must follow the **ULBS Design System** for consistent look and feel.

### Design System Resources

- **Figma Design Guidelines**: [ULBS Visual Guidelines](https://www.figma.com/design/6l4FWSiHc1u4oCUwRS3Q2s/ULBS-Visual-guidelines)
- Access the Figma file for:
  - Color palette
  - Typography system
  - Component library
  - Spacing and layout guidelines
  - Icons and imagery

### Implementation Requirements

✅ **Colors**: Use the defined ULBS color palette
✅ **Typography**: Follow font families, sizes, and weights from design system
✅ **Components**: Use pre-defined components when available
✅ **Spacing**: Follow the spacing scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
✅ **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance minimum

### Design Tokens

Projects should use design tokens for consistency:

<details>
<summary>Example Design Tokens (CSS Variables)</summary>

```css
/* Example CSS Variables */
:root {
  --color-primary: #your-primary-color;
  --color-secondary: #your-secondary-color;
  --font-family-base: "Your Font", sans-serif;
  --spacing-unit: 8px;
  --border-radius: 4px;
}
```

</details>

---

## 🏢 Organization Structure

### GitHub Organization & Teams

All Code4ULBS projects follow this organizational structure:

#### Team Management

✅ **Every project has a dedicated Team** in the ULBS GitHub Organization
✅ **All members are added to Teams**, not directly to repositories
✅ **Teams have appropriate permissions** (Read, Write, Maintain, Admin)
✅ **Team structure reflects project structure**

**Example teams:**

- `gradis-team` - Members working on Gradis project
- `ulbs-connect-team` - Members working on ULBS Connect
- `schedule-team` - Members working on Schedule project

#### GitHub Projects

✅ **Each project has a GitHub Project board** for tracking work
✅ **Projects group related repositories** together
✅ **Projects use consistent labels and milestones**

**Project Board Structure:**

```
To Do → In Progress → QA → Done
```

#### Repository Access

- ❌ **Never add users directly to repositories**
- ✅ **Always add users to the appropriate team**
- ✅ **Teams are granted repository access**
- ✅ **Use team mentions for code reviews** (@ULBS/gradis-team)

### Benefits of Team-Based Access

- Easier onboarding and offboarding
- Consistent permissions across repositories
- Better collaboration and communication
- Simplified access management

✅ Be linked to an **existing issue**
✅ Issue must describe the **need for change** (bug, feature, task, improvement)
✅ Issue must be **assigned to a developer**
✅ Issue must be **linked to a GitHub Project**

### Issue Statuses

All issues must move through these states:

1. **To Do** - Issue is identified and prioritized
2. **In Progress** - Work has started
3. **QA** - Work is complete, pending quality assurance
4. **Done** - Work is verified and merged to main

### Issue Templates
